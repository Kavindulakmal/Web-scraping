# Web-scraping
Web scraping is a process that uses bots to extract data from a website. It's different from screen scraping, which only copies pixels on the screen. Here I used Python for Scripting.

### Prerequisites
1. install python
2. a IDE (Depend on you)

### Running the project
1. Ensure that you are in the project home directory. Create the virtual environment by running the below command from the command prompt -
```
python -m venv .env
```
And activate the virtual environment by running the below command from the command prompt
```
.env\Scripts\activate
```
and install Requirements using
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
Run the python file and check the output.
